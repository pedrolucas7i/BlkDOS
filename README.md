# BLKDOS

**BLKDOS** is a server program that blocks suspicious connections and potential DOS attacks

### Going to be tested in these OS's
![Debian Logo](/images/Debian-logo.jpg)
- **Debian**
  - Version: `12`
  - Desktop Mode: CLI

![Ubuntu Server Logo](/images/Ubuntu-Server-Logo.jpg)
- **Ubuntu Server**
  - Version: `24.04.1 LTS`
  - Desktop Mode: CLI

![Windows 11 Logo](/images/Windows-11-Logo.png)
- **Windows**
  - Version: `10/11`
  - Desktop Mode: GUI

### How It Works
The program will cancel the connections not recognized by blocking the IP address of the external machine that is having unusual actions or/and traffic. Using a conf file you are able to insert mannualy the hosts that are more aggressive to give the app the indications that is normal a connection
