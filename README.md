# BLKDOS

**BLKDOS** is a server program that blocks suspicious connections and potential DOS attacks

### Going to be tested in these OS's
<br>

- ![Debian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Debian-black?style=flat&logo=debian&logoColor=%23A81D33&labelColor=white)
  - Version: `12`
  - Desktop Mode: CLI
<br>

- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-black?style=flat&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23E95420)
  - Version: `24.04.1 LTS`
  - Desktop Mode: CLI
<br>

- **Windows**
  - Version: `10/11`
  - Desktop Mode: GUI

### How It Works
The program will cancel the connections not recognized by blocking the IP address of the external machine that is having unusual actions or/and traffic. Using a conf file you are able to insert mannualy the hosts that are more aggressive to give the app the indications that is normal a connection
